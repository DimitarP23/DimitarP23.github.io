    <p>I plan to work part time jobs in order to be able to pay my rent and have enough money to live healthy and peacefully.I know that it wont affect my studies because it wont be a full time job and i will have enough time to communicate and have fun at the same time.In my spare time i love to ride my bike,go hiking or do a bit of crypto trading.</p>
