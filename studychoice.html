                <h2>WHY DID I CHOOSE TO STUDY ICT?</h2>
                <p>I chose ICT because it allows me to channel my creativity into crafting innovative solutions and
                    designs
                    using digital tools and technology, fulfilling my passion for imaginative expression in the digital
                    realm.Additionally,I am excited about the prospect of connecting with like-minded individuals who
                    share
                    similar ambitions for their future and personal growth.</p>

                <h2>WHAT INITIATIVES DID I TAKE TO MAKE MY STUDY CHOICE? </h2>
                <p>Before choosing to study ICT in HZ i talked with students who were already going through their
                    first/second year.They gave me a lot of information on how the program is structured,way of teaching
                    and
                    prospects of studying it.
                    Ofcourse i also did a diligent online research, and comprehensive exploration of career
                    opportunities
                    within the field in order for me to get a better understanding of the ICT field itself.

                <h2>MY MOTIVATION</h2>
                <p>I am motivated not only by the fact that i see myself as a creative person and creativity is the main
                    unit of
                    ICT, but also the fact
                    that last year i studied a program that was definitely not for me and failed to complete it.I did
                    lost a
                    whole
                    year but i am happy that i know i tried and it wasnt my thing.I am also
                    motivated by the thought that without education it is very difficult to live nowadays and ICT offers
                    great
                    career
                    opportunities and will continue to do so.My motivation also comes
                    from my friends and family and ofcourse from myself-i know that this time i have choosen the right
                    program and
                    feel motivated enough and 100% certain that i will graduate from it.</p>
